Differential line driver/converter for position encoders

Differential quadrature output can typically be connected to the servo drive with a four-pair UTP cable - e.g. common Cat. 5 patch cable.
One pair for A, one pair for B, one pair for index and one pair for Vcc/Ground (Vcc = +5V, and the encoder itself also needs to accept 5V.)
Power is supplied to the encoder, and the converter board, from the servo drive end.
